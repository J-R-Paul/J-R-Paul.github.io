          <p>
            While the startup cities industry is still small, it is already quite heterogeneous. Each project has its own distinct set of goals, motivations, and scope. However, this diversity isn't fully captured by the vocabulary we use right now.
          </p>

          <p>
            To help myself create a mental map of the industry, I've grouped these motivations into 5 categories. I've also included examples of places that personify each motivation. (Some of those examples wouldn't self-identify as "startup cities" but to me embody that spirit nonetheless.)
          </p>

          <p>
            These motivations aren't necessarily incompatible with each other. In fact, they're generally symbiotic, and I suspect most startup cities are motivated by many or all of them. The question is one of priority. Which of these goals is a project's main attractor for residents? Which are desirable but not central to the project's mission? The answers to those questions will determine the trade-offs each startup city will make.
          </p>

          <p>
            I'm publishing this ontology for three reasons. I hope to:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Create shared vocabulary so builders can communicate clearly with their residents, investors, team, and other stakeholders.
            </li>
            <li>
              Encourage builders to sharpen their focus on what they're trying to do — and explicitly recognize what they're not trying to do.
            </li>
            <li>
              Receive feedback about this list so that I can sharpen my own mental model about how various projects in the space relate to one another. I write to learn!
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            So let's have at it! Here are the different categories of answers I've heard to the question "What are startup cities for?": Economic opportunity, Competitive governance, Lifestyle, Community, and Technological experimentation.
          </p>

          <h2>1. Economic opportunity</h2>

          <p>
            Unleash economic development, reducing poverty and unemployment. Improve infrastructure, labor law, commercial law, tax structure, bureaucratic efficiency, etc in order to support employers in starting and operating businesses.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              The <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/Event/Africa/Investing%20in%20Africa%20Forum/2015/investing-in-africa-forum-global-experiences-with-special-economic-zones-with-a-focus-on-china-and-africa.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shenzhen Special Economic Zone</a> (SEZ) was the testbed for market-oriented reforms that the Chinese government introduced in the 1980s and 1990s, which lifted <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/country/china/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">800 million</a> people out of poverty. Shenzhen was able to innovate because the SEZ regime <a href="https://documents1.worldbank.org/curated/en/294021468213279589/pdf/564470PUB0buil10Box349496B01PUBLIC1.pdf#page=93" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">delegated almost all management authority to the provincial government</a>, decoupling it from national policies.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://explorer.school/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nkwashi</a>'s educational system will focus on growing Zambians to become software developers and digital designers, helping them access high-quality jobs.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="https://prospera.hn/business" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Próspera</a> is creating economic opportunity in Honduras by building better physical and legal infrastructure, and by diversifying the tourism-centric economy on Roatán, the Caribbean island where it's located. Residents have access to high-quality remote jobs, fast wifi, dependable electricity, and potable water. Próspera has also streamlined processes such as registering a new business and hiring employees by building an entirely new legal, regulatory, and governance framework based on best practices from places like Dubai.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>2. Competitive governance</h2>

          <p>
            Innovate on how governments deliver services to their residents, and in turn exert competitive pressure on other jurisdictions to push them to improve their services as well.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://e-estonia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estonia</a> offers 99% of its public services online, and it has an e-residency program that provides foreigners access to Estonia's transparent business environment. I personally know Argentinians who've chosen to start businesses via e-Estonia because they trust it more than their local government.
            </li>
            <li>
              <a href="http://ojs.instituteforcompgov.org/plugins/generic/pdfJsViewer/pdf.js/web/viewer.html?file=http%3A%2F%2Fojs.instituteforcompgov.org%2Findex.php%2Fjsj%2Fissue%2Fdownload%2F4%2FSpecial%2520Issue%2520on%2520the%2520Honduran%2520ZEDEs#page=10&zoom=auto,-253,648" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Próspera</a> is introducing new democratic institutions to Honduras, providing citizens new avenues for democratic political participation. For example, Próspera has something called a "snap referendum": any council action can be vetoed by popular referendum within 14 days, giving residents more sovereignty over their community than any other jurisdiction in Honduras.
            </li>
          </ul>
